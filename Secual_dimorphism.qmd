```{r include = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
```

These charts show which traits are sexually dimorphic and which are not.

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = sex)) +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~species)

```
